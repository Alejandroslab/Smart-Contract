# TO DO LIST TO BAKE THE CAKE 

WATCH
1. Try in another Parity with Kovan. -- DONE (works but functions of transfer and also SUPPLY don't work. Something is missing? Of course.)
2. Try in Ethereum Wallet (missing JSON interface of the token: ways to get the JSON interface from parity?)
[JSON is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).]

DEVELOPMENT
1. Fix the code (not working the transfer function and the supply) (STUDY SOLIDITY! Solidity is derived from Javascript. Or just try to understand the code written in the noob official guides from Parity or Ethereum)

  -Trying with ethereum code the one from official website guide (not working functions)
  -Tryng with snippets of Parity (https://github.com/paritytech/parity/tree/master/js/src/contracts/snippets)
  (Main repository: https://github.com/paritytech/parity)
    (Seems the same: not working function)
    
      --Check 'throw' function is deprecated. Instead use require or else?
    
      --Why it doesn't appear the possibility to choose the token, a part of eth, in Parity? Is it a problem/feature of Parity?

2. Check ERC20 Interface standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20)
