first plug in the exec in terminal (in order to get the correct directory where to invoke parity ) then type:

parity —-chain kovan —-pruning archive

or (it’s the same):

parity —-chain=kovan —-pruning archive

(without pruning archive it will not work)

to change to main net :

parity —-chain homestead
