You can find your chain data downloaded here:

%LOCALAPPDATA%/Parity/Ethereum/chains/<network>

(Just copy and paste on address bar)

It was moved to this location from the original location of %APPDATA%/* because AppData/Roaming (which is where %APPDATA% points) is synced over the network on login/logout while AppData/Local (where %LOCALAPPDATA% points) is not.
