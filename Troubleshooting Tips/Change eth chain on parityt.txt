first plug in the exec in terminal (in order to get the correct directory where to invoke parity ) then type:

parity —-chain kovan —-no-warp

or (it’s the same):

parity —-chain=kovan —-no-warp

You could use operation mode --pruning archive but you will need at least 326 gb of space for the sync of blockchain.
Using --no-warp mode decrease the size of blockchain to about 20-30 gb of space.

to change back to main net :

parity —-chain homestead

(here you can use --no-warp here too)
