The best advice I can give you is to start studying at the contracts created by the OpenZeppelin project. 

They provide several reviewed contracts that are used as base for projects with a public ICO. 

For more complex type of tokens you can take a look at TokenMarketNet ICO repository.

Also you should start with a framework like Truffle or Populus, that make creating, testing and deploying contracts much easier.

But you should try to keep up to date with current best practices, at any time a new vulnerability can appear. 

And the current best practices sometimes changes every month.

You will have to start publiciting your project and how users will get rewards. 

Talk to the community, exchanges, potential investors. 

Then launch your token, if the potential investors believe your project is good they will invest and acquire your tokens. 

Exchanges will start trading your token if it is popular enough.
