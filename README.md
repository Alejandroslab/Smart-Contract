# Creating a Token. An attempt.

The aim of this work is to create a simple and basic token on Ethereum Blockchain. 
First the work will be done on Kovan Testnet and then it could be deployed in the main net.

A sort of Hello World :)

Just a try.

# Parity + Kovan

Got Parity and then changed the chain from Homestead to Kovan (no Reptest for safe).
