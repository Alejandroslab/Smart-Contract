# The Creation of a Token. An attempt.

The aim of this work is to create a simple and basic token on ethereum blockchain. 
At first I'm going to work on Kovan Testnet and then I will deploy in the main net if there is not anything else to fix.

A sort of hello world for cryptos :)

Anyways it's just a try.

# Kovan and Parity

I dowloaded Parity and the changed the chain from Homestead to Kovan (no Reptest fors safe).
